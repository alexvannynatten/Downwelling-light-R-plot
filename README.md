# Downwelling-light-R-plot

This R code plots the change in the breadth of the visible spectrum of light with depth. 
Attenuation coefficient data is based on values from Jerlov "Marine Optics" and represent the difference in the attenuation of light over a gradient, from very clear (Type I) to turbid (9) in marine waters.
Lines show the depth at which only 1% of irradiance at the surface remains.
